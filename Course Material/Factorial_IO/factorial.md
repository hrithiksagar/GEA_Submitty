Implement a function in C to compute factorial of a integer number.
* The function should return -1 for negative numbers.
* Factorial of a number for positive numbers.
* Do not add any additional prints in the code

Sample input:
4
1
2
-1
0

Explaination:
    * First line is the number of inputs.
    * Next lines are the integers to which the factorial needs to be found
    
Sample output:
1
2
-1
1



Explanation:
    * Factorial of 1 is 1
    * Factorial of 2 is 4
    * Factorial of -1 is -1
    * Factorial of 0 is 1
