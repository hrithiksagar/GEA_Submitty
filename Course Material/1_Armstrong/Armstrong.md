# Implement a function in C++ to check whether number is Armstrong or not.
* A positive integer is called an Armstrong number (of order n) if
* abcd... = a^n + b^n + c^n + d^n + ...
* where n is the number of digits in the given number
# Sample input:
3
123 1000 370

# Explaination:
    * First line is the number of inputs.
    * Next line is the integers which must be checked seperated by space
    
# Sample output:
NO
NO
YES

# Explaination:
	* 123 is not a Armstrong number because 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 is not equal to 123
    * 1000 is not a Armstrong number because 1^4 + 0^4 + 0^4 + 0^4 is not equal to 1000
    * 370 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 is equal to 370

# Submitty Evaluation
* Implement your code in a file named "armstrong.c" and upload to the Armstrong gradable.
* Mismatch in the name of file will cause opilation error and no sore will be given.
* First 3 submissions can get full score
	* 4th submission will have 50% of the total score as penalty.
	* 5th submission will have 100% of the total score as penalty.
* Test your code locally before uploading.
