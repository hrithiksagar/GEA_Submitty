Implement a multi file program to find samllest digit in the positive integer number
* main.c - main code and calls functions from other source code files
    * Do not upload this file and hence no changes at user end is useful
    * All code to print and read form user is taken care. 
    * Do not add any additional prints.
* smallest_digit.c - implements function to find the smallest digit in the positive integer number
* smallest_digit.h - provides prototype for the below function
    * int FindSmallest (int InputNumber)

main.c files contains all the required functions and header files and user need to implement smallest_digit.h and smallest_digit.c files only. 
Upload smallest_digit.h and smallest_digit.c file to submitty. Adding any other file will cause errors and losing of the score.
